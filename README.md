# trashcan
## "the name of this trashcan is Visual Basic"

trashcan is a simple language with abbreviated syntax (similar to Rust,
in which the compiler is not conincidentally written) which compiles to
Visual Basic (the old, gross one).

Key features of the trashcan language over VB include:  
* [x] No more damn case insensitivity  
* [ ] Short-circuiting boolean expressions  
* [ ] Generic types and functions  
* [ ] Simplified iteration (for-each loops)  
* [x] Mandatory typing with limited type-checking enhancements  
* [x] Syntactic conveniences (e.g. += and friends)  
* [ ] Array and structure literals  
* [ ] Objects with constructors (use validated only for trashcan code)  
* [ ] Somehow, improved error handling (?)  
* [ ] Closures (?)  

trashcan is inspired by previous work on extending the VB language with m4 macros: https://gist.github.com/derrickturk/5c01caab93bbd6bc9ddd
