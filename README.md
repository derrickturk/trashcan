# trashcan
## "the name of this trashcan is Visual Basic"

trashcan is a simple language with abbreviated syntax which compiles to
Visual Basic (the old, gross one).
trashcan also may be written as trashcan basic (\*.tcb), which extends the syntax Visual Basic to provide the new features of trashcan, while applying the checking provided by the trashcan compiler.

Key features of the trashcan language over VB include:  
* Generic types and functions  
* Simplified iteration (for-each loops)  
* Mandatory typing with limited type-checking enhancements  
* Syntactic conveniences (e.g. += and friends)  
* Array and structure literals  
* Objects with constructors (use validated only for trashcan code)  
* Somehow, improved error handling (?)  
* Closures (?)  

trashcan is inspired by previous work on extending the VB language with m4 macros: https://gist.github.com/derrickturk/5c01caab93bbd6bc9ddd
